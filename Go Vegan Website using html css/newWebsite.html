    <p class="container-lg bg-success text-dark bg-opacity-10 border border-sucess border-2 col-10 mx-5 my-4 rounded" style="display: flex;">"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is
      possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any
      other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the
      benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with
      all products derived wholly or partly from animals."</p>
    <p class="container-lg text-dark col-10 mx-5 my-4 fw-bold">
      There are many ways to embrace vegan living. Yet one thing all vegans have in common is a plant-based diet
      avoiding all animal foods such as meat (including fish, shellfish and insects), dairy, eggs and honey - as
      well as avoiding animal-derived materials, products tested on animals and places that use animals for
      entertainment.
    </p>
    <p class="container-lg text-dark col-10 mx-5 my-4 ">Some people may choose to go vegan, for some it may be
      because they do not believe in farmed animal practices and animal exploitation, for others it may be due to
      environmental concerns. Whatever the reason The Vegan Society is here to support everyone on their vegan
      journey.

  <nav class="container-lg text-dark col-7 mx-5 my-4 ">
    <p>Although the vegan diet was defined early on in The Vegan Society's beginnings in 1944, by Donald Watson and
      our founding members.It was as late as 1949 before Leslie J Cross pointed out that the society lacked a
      definition of veganism. He suggested “[t]he principle of the emancipation of animals from exploitation by
      man”. This is later clarified as “to seek an end to the use of animals by man for food, commodities, work,
      hunting, vivisection, and by all other uses involving exploitation of animal life by man”.</p>
    <p>The society was first registered as a charity in August 1964 but its assets were later transferred to a new
      charity when it also became a limited company in December 1979. The definition of veganism and the
      charitable objects of the society were amended and refined over the years. By winter 1988 the current
      definition was in use - although the phrasing has changed slightly over the years.</p>
